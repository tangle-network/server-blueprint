# Server Blueprint for Tangle Network üåê

## üöÄ Project Overview & Purpose

This project is a blueprint for Tangle Network, designed to deploy and manage any HTTP server, database, or containerized application. When requesting a new instance of this blueprint, users get a new service instance with a specified configuration that enables seamless server deployment and management across multiple runtime environments.

Blueprints are specifications for <abbr title="Actively Validated Services">AVS</abbr>s on the Tangle Network. An AVS is an off-chain service that runs arbitrary computations for a user-specified period of time. This Server Blueprint provides a powerful abstraction for deploying and managing any type of server across different runtime environments, allowing developers to create reusable server infrastructures.

For more details about Tangle Network Blueprints, please refer to the [project documentation](https://docs.tangle.tools/developers/blueprints/introduction).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details

The blueprint supports configurations for various runtimes with automatic port management. Two transport modes are available depending on your server type:

### Supported Runtimes

- **JavaScript (bun runtime)**: Executes any JavaScript/Node.js applications using `bunx` with automatic bun installation if needed
- **Python (python3)**: Executes any Python applications using `uvx` with automatic uv installation if needed  
- **Docker containers**: Runs any containerized application with intelligent port discovery, automatic port allocation, and environment variable injection

### Transport Modes

- **`transportAdapter: "none"`**: **Recommended for most servers** - Direct HTTP server deployment without any transport conversion (perfect for web servers, APIs, databases)
- **`transportAdapter: "stdioToSSE"`**: For specialized applications that communicate via STDIO and need SSE conversion

### Port Management & Transport Conversion

The blueprint automatically manages port allocation and converts all runtime configurations to SSE transport:

**Automatic Port Management:**

- Ports are automatically allocated using the system's available port detection
- The `PORT` environment variable is automatically injected into all servers
- Servers **should** bind to the port specified in the `PORT` environment variable for optimal compatibility
- No manual port configuration required in blueprint requests
- Docker containers have intelligent port discovery and mapping

**Direct Server Access:**

- HTTP-based communication for standard web servers and APIs
- Built-in authentication and authorization layer
- Automatic container lifecycle management  
- Support for environment variable injection

## üîê Authentication Workflow

The authentication workflow uses the script [`generate-auth-token.ts`](generate-auth-token.ts) to generate an access token through a challenge-response mechanism:

1. **Challenge Request**: Client sends public key and key type to `/v1/auth/challenge`
2. **Challenge Response**: Server returns a cryptographic challenge with expiration
3. **Signature Generation**: Client signs the challenge using their private key
4. **Token Verification**: Client submits signature to `/v1/auth/verify` endpoint
5. **Access Token**: Server returns a time-limited access token

Authentication is performed via an `Authorization` header when accessing the deployed server URL. The token format is `{token_id}|{token_string}`.

## üìã Changelog & Breaking Changes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Migration from MCP Blueprint**: This is a generalized version of the MCP blueprint for any server type. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed migration instructions and examples.

**Key Features:**

- Automatic port allocation and management
- Support for any HTTP server, database, or containerized application
- Built-in authentication and security layer
- Multi-runtime support (Python, JavaScript, Docker)

## üöÄ Usage Examples & Demos

### Sample Configurations

The [`fixtures`](fixtures) directory contains sample configurations for different server types:

**Web Servers:**
- **[`fixtures/nginx_server.json`](fixtures/nginx_server.json)**: Nginx web server
- **[`fixtures/apache_server.json`](fixtures/apache_server.json)**: Apache HTTP server

**Databases:**
- **[`fixtures/postgres_database.json`](fixtures/postgres_database.json)**: PostgreSQL database with credentials
- **[`fixtures/redis_database.json`](fixtures/redis_database.json)**: Redis cache server

**Application Servers:**
- **[`fixtures/nodejs_app.json`](fixtures/nodejs_app.json)**: Node.js application server
- **[`fixtures/python_fastapi.json`](fixtures/python_fastapi.json)**: Python FastAPI application

**Legacy MCP Examples:**
- **[`fixtures/00_mcp_python3.json`](fixtures/00_mcp_python3.json)**: Python MCP server configuration
- **[`fixtures/01_mcp_js.json`](fixtures/01_mcp_js.json)**: JavaScript MCP server

> **Note**: Most configurations use `"transportAdapter": "none"` for direct HTTP server deployment. Port allocation is handled automatically by the blueprint.

### Local Setup

To run the setup locally, follow the detailed instructions in [`DEMO.md`](DEMO.md). The demo covers:

1. Starting Tangle network locally
2. Spawning the blueprint service
3. Requesting a new blueprint instance
4. Accepting the service request
5. Starting the MCP server
6. Generating authentication tokens
7. Testing with MCP Inspector

### Internal Workflow

For a detailed understanding of the internal workflow, see [`mcp-blueprint-flowchart.md`](mcp-blueprint-flowchart.md), which provides a comprehensive flowchart showing:

- User request flow and configuration processing
- Runtime detection and package management
- Transport conversion from STDIO to SSE
- Server initialization and endpoint provision
- Authentication and client connection handling

## üîÑ Workflow Description

The blueprint process follows this high-level workflow:

1. **Request Reception**: Receives a server deployment request with configuration parameters
2. **Configuration Processing**: Analyzes runtime type, package/image, and environment variables  
3. **Port Allocation**: Automatically allocates an available port and injects it as `PORT` environment variable
4. **Runtime Initialization**:
   - **Python**: Installs/uses `uv` for package management and execution
   - **JavaScript**: Installs/uses `bun` for package management and execution
   - **Docker**: Pulls images, inspects for exposed ports, and creates containers with intelligent port binding
5. **Server Deployment**: Launches the server/application in the specified runtime environment
6. **Endpoint Exposure**: Provides HTTP URL for direct server access
7. **Authentication**: Secures access through token-based authentication system  
8. **Client Interaction**: Enables clients to connect directly to the deployed server via HTTP

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Forge](https://getfoundry.sh)

```sh
cargo tangle blueprint deploy
```

to deploy the blueprint to the Tangle network.

### Quick Reference for Server Developers

When developing servers for this blueprint:

1. **Read Port from Environment**: Use `process.env.PORT` (JS) or `os.environ['PORT']` (Python) when possible
2. **Bind to All Interfaces**: Use `0.0.0.0` as the host for container compatibility
3. **Docker EXPOSE**: For Docker images, use `EXPOSE` directive for automatic port discovery
4. **Environment Variables**: Access injected environment variables for configuration
5. **Test Locally**: Set `PORT=3000` environment variable for local testing

```bash
# Testing your server locally
export PORT=3000
your-server-command

# Docker example with port environment variable
docker run -e PORT=8080 -p 8080:8080 your-image
```
